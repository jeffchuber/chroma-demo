# Chroma Demo 

This demo is focused around *evaluation* and *automated analysis* of embeddings.

A common problem of working with embeddings is figuring out: 
- What embedding model should I use?
- Where do I know things and where do I not know things?

For this, we are going to look at simple approaches to model both of these! 

We are going to use the Biden's State of the Union Address as our Document
